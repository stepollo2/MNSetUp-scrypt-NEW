### 2.2 VPS setup
1. Register on [Aruba] https://www.arubacloud.com/vps/virtual-private-server-range.aspx and setup small VPS server (for 1 eur/month).

1. Send some money to your account to deploy a server. 
1.  - Server Type: Ubuntu 16.04
    - Server Size: 1GB memory (This server is capable to run 3 masternodes. One masternode need 150-300Mb memory)

## 3. FAQ


1. How to get masternode profit?
	- Enable coin controll feature (Settings => Options => Display => Display coin controll feature)
	- Go send tab
	- Select from the input button only the 5 coin lines
	- Click OK
	- You can send selected amount to an address.
	- Note: DO NOT EVER Transfer TRTT from that original 50k deposit or you'll break your Masternode.
1. What is the password for the tritt account on VPS?
	- There is no default password. When you create a user it does not have a password.
1. I get the following error: "Could not allocate vin"
	- Make sure your wallet fully synced and UNLOCKED.
1. How many masternodes can I run using one IP/server?
	- The limit is only the memory. One masternode requires 150-300MB ram. A server with 1GB memory can run 3 masternodes. But only one Trittium MN can work with one public IP.
1. I got stuck. Can you help me?
